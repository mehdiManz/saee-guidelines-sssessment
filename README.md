1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Review the SAEE guidelines provided by the English Club.
3. Assess your English proficiency and adherence to the guidelines by answering the assessment questions.

## Guidelines and Assessments

The provided `index.html` file contains the structure and elements of the assessment tool's user interface. The corresponding styles are defined in the `style.css` file.

The guidelines and their corresponding assessments are managed in the `script.js` file using JavaScript. You can customize the guidelines or add new ones by modifying the `guidelines` array in the script.

```javascript
const guidelines = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Guideline 1",
    description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Guideline 2",
    description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",
  },
  // Add more guidelines here
];
```
